Order food directly from table without the need of a waiter The food ordering process in many full-service restaurants comprise of several steps starting after the guests got seated in the restaurant. A waiter would bring a paper based menu for browsing and waits for the guests to make decision on ordering the items. Such process has at least two limitations, one is ordering must be done in the restaurant and secondly, the waiter must wait for the guests to browse the menu and make a decision. While the restaurant is one of the business sectors in service industry with high competition, elimination or reduction of such limitation will be greatly beneficial to the business owner in terms of a wider channel to attract more customers, promote efficiency and reduce service cost.
